# LSTM-Model-for-Sequence-Learning-Prediction-using-MNIST

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **end‑to‑end implementation of an LSTM (Long Short‑Term Memory) neural network** for sequence learning and prediction tasks. LSTM is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture **long‑term dependencies** in sequential data and overcome the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs.

The complete workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook:

```

## ⚙️ Notebook Workflow

1. Import required Python libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Preprocess data (scaling, sequencing, train‑test split)
4. Build LSTM model architecture
5. Compile the model (optimizer, loss, metrics)
6. Train the model over multiple epochs
7. Evaluate performance on test data
8. Visualize results and predictions

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The LSTM network typically consists of:

* **Input Layer** – fixed‑length sequences
* **LSTM Layer(s)** – capture temporal patterns
* **Dense Output Layer** – final prediction
* **Softmax / Regression Head** – based on task type

LSTM cells use gated mechanisms to retain or forget information, making them effective for long‑range sequence modeling.

## 📊 Training & Evaluation

* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy / MSE
* **Metrics:** Accuracy, MSE
* **Epochs & Batch Size:** Configurable

Training and validation curves are plotted for better performance analysis.
